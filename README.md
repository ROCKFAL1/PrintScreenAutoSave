# PrintScreenAutoSave
Automatically saves all your screenshots taken with the PrintScreen button.     
All your screenshots will be saved in folder *C:\Users\Public\Pictures\PrintScreenAutoSave*.    
The program works on the background and [antiviruses can assume that the program is a virus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa). You need to start it only once when you turn on the system or put it in autorun.
The program consumes about 600 Kb of RAM and it works fast due to the fact that it takes information from the clipboard!
