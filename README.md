# PrintScreenAutoSave
It happens that you often take screenshots using a print screen and forget to save them. This program automatically saves all your screenshots.    
Your screenshots will be saved in folder *C:\Users\Public\Pictures\PrintScreenAutoSave*.    
Utility works on the background and [antiviruses can assume that the program is a virus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa).
The program is very lightweight and it works fast due to the fact that it takes information from the clipboard!
